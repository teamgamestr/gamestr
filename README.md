## For Game Developers

### Quick Integration

1. **Create a Nostr Identity** for your game
2. **Choose a Game Identifier** (e.g., "my-awesome-game")
3. **Publish Score Events** when players achieve scores

### Example: Publishing a Score (JavaScript)

```javascript
import { SimplePool, getPublicKey, finalizeEvent } from 'nostr-tools';

const pool = new SimplePool();
const relays = ['wss://relay.nostr.band', 'wss://relay.damus.io'];

async function publishScore(playerPubkey, score, metadata = {}) {
  const event = {
    kind: 30762,
    created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
    content: 'New high score!',
    tags: [
      ['d', `my-game:${playerPubkey}:default`], // Unique identifier for replaceable event
      ['game', 'my-awesome-game'],
      ['score', score.toString()],
      ['p', playerPubkey],
      ['state', 'active'], // Score state
      ['t', 'arcade'], // Genre tag
    ],
  };

  const signedEvent = finalizeEvent(event, gamePrivateKey);
  await Promise.any(pool.publish(relays, signedEvent));
  
  return signedEvent;
}
```

### Score Event Structure (Kind 30762)

```json
{
  "kind": 30762,
  "pubkey": "game-developer-pubkey",
  "created_at": 1698765432,
  "content": "New high score achieved!",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "my-awesome-game:player-pubkey:level-12"],
    ["game", "my-awesome-game"],
    ["score", "15000"],
    ["p", "player-pubkey"],
    ["state", "active"],
    ["level", "12"],
    ["difficulty", "hard"],
    ["mode", "single-player"],
    ["t", "arcade"]
  ]
}
```

### Required Tags

- `d` - Unique identifier (format: `game:timestamp:random`)
- `game` - Your game identifier (lowercase, hyphenated)
- `score` - Numeric score value (as string)
- `p` - Player's Nostr pubkey

### Optional Tags

## Game Metadata Configuration

Games are configured in `src/lib/gameConfig.ts`. Each game is indexed by `<developer-pubkey>:<game-identifier>`:

```typescript
export const INITIAL_GAME_CONFIG: GameConfigMap = {
  'dev-pubkey:game-id': {
    name: 'My Awesome Game',
    description: 'An amazing game description',
    image: 'https://example.com/game-image.jpg',
    genres: ['arcade', 'casual'],
    url: 'https://example.com/play',
    developer: 'Developer Name',
    featured: true,
    trending: false,
    newRelease: false,
  },
};
```
